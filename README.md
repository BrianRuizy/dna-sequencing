# dna-sequencing
CS 3306 - C++ program that extracts matching patterns from a given input DNA sequence string, using Deterministic Finite Automata.

## About 
The scope of this program is to practice and showcase understanding of deterministic finite automata. In essence the program implements a deterministic finite automata (DFA) using C++ programming language to extract matching patterns from a given input DNA sequence string.
